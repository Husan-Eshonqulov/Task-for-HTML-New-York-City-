        <h1>New York City</h1>
        <p>
          New York City is made up of five boroughs which include Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The city is the home of approximately 8 million people. In 1876, France gifted the City of New York what is known as the Statue of Liberty, which is currently located on Ellis Island commonly visited by tourists. However, it took 10 years to assemble and therefore wasn't unveiled untill 1886. Another tourist destination is Times Square. Times Square is commonly known for the big buildings, Broadway shows, and bright neon signs. This famous lacotion was named after The New York Time after the Times moved to that location. Prior to that, it was named Longacre Square. New York City also known for its bridges that connect the boroughts and allow ease of transportation.
